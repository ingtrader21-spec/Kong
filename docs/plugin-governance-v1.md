# Kong Plugin Governance V1

Part of the [Kong API Gateway Control Plane V1](KONG_GATEWAY_CONTROL_PLANE_V1.md).
Machine-readable authority: `config/kong-gateway-foundation.v1.json` (`plugins[]`,
`pluginGovernance`). Validator: `python3 scripts/validate_kong_foundation.py`.

## Rules

1. Every plugin name that appears in any reviewed source (declarative
   candidate, contract, renderer, readback, standby design, integration policy
   template) must be registered with `plugin`, `kind`, `allowedScopes`,
   `owner`, `purpose`, `configurationSources`, `securityImpact`,
   `orderingDependency`, `environments` and `priority`. A source that uses a
   plugin without being listed as one of its configuration sources fails.
2. Scope is explicit: `GLOBAL`, `SERVICE`, `ROUTE`, `CONSUMER`. Only
   `prometheus` may be global; every other plugin is scoped to the service or
   route whose contract it enforces. Authentication plugins can never be global
   because their audience differs per service (`codestra-control-plane`,
   `codestra-callback-api`, `codestra-middleware`, `middleware-api`,
   `moneybee-api`, `sdk-intake`, `codestra-api`).
3. `kong/plugins/oidc/keycloak.yml` is literally a top-level `plugins:` list —
   a global `openid-connect` if ever loaded as a declarative document. It is
   registered as a `PLUGIN_TEMPLATE` with activation `TEMPLATE_NOT_LOADABLE`;
   reconcilers copy its bearer settings onto services.
4. Authentication must be explicit per route class. A route whose plugin set
   contains no authentication plugin is `PUBLIC` with a reason, `BLOCKED`, or a
   non-activatable design with a declared gap — never an authenticated route by
   omission.
5. Claim guards (`post-function`, `codestra-authz`) run only after a token
   authentication plugin on the same route/service; the validator checks the
   priority relation on every desired source. `pre-function` is reserved for
   raw request-metadata guards (`deploy/kong/correlation-required.lua` on the
   calling contract) and is never a claim guard.
6. Plugin configuration values are never trusted from a name-only listing.
   The production readback records names only; the reconcilers verify exact
   configuration (`require_config_subset`, exact drift errors) against the
   contracts before any apply.

## Ordering

Kong executes access-phase plugins by descending priority. The invariants the
configuration relies on:

| Order | Plugin(s) | Why the order matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pre-function` (1000000), `codestra-request-context` (100002), `correlation-id` (100001) | request identity and correlation are fixed before any decision; caller-supplied identity headers are stripped before authentication |
| 2 | `ip-restriction` (3000), `bot-detection` (2500), `cors` (2000) | source and preflight controls run before credentials; a denied source never reaches a credential check, and `OPTIONS` preflights are answered without credentials |
| 3 | `jwt` (1450), `key-auth` (1250), `openid-connect` (1050), `mtls-auth` (1006), `codestra-webhook-verifier` (1000) | authentication; the signature/issuer/expiry/audience decision |
| 4 | `request-size-limiting` (951), `rate-limiting` (910) | after authentication so an anonymous oversized or noisy request is rejected 401 first; counters are keyed by consumer where a credential exists |
| 5 | `codestra-authz` (900), `request-transformer` (801), `response-transformer` (800) | prerequisites and header shaping on an authenticated request; transformers never add identity headers a guard did not mint |
| 6 | `request-termination` (2) | explicit deny for quarantined or disabled variants |
| 7 | `post-function` (-1000) | claim guards: the only serverless phase that observes the result of authentication |
| log | `prometheus` (13) | metrics; independent |

Priorities are the Kong Gateway 3.x bundled values; custom plugins declare
`PRIORITY` in their handler. The comment in `deploy/kong/control-plane.yml`
quotes older 2.x values for `openid-connect`/`jwt`; the invariant it protects
(post-function after every authentication plugin) holds on 3.x as well.

The one live deviation is recorded as drift: the 2026-09-06 readback shows the
two callback routes running their claim guard as `pre-function`. Because `jwt`
still gates the signature on the same route, the composed decision is
unchanged, but the guard runs on unverified claims and the ordering is wrong;
the callback reconciler moves it to `post-function` on apply.

## Rate-limit, request-size and CORS authority

Rate limiting uses the `redis` policy with `fault_tolerant: false` on every
canonical route so that N nodes share one counter and an unreachable Redis
fails closed; only the private standby node uses `policy: local`. Per-route
profiles live in `profiles.rateLimit` (see the route registry). Request-size
profiles bound bodies per traffic class; Kong never validates application
schemas. CORS is a Kong concern only on legacy browser routes
(`cors` + `key-auth`, finding `CORS_WITH_SHARED_KEY`); canonical service routes
have no browser origin and no `cors` plugin, and
`corsCredentialsWithWildcardOriginAllowed` is `false` — the integration
compiler rejects wildcard origins outright.
